# Lab 2 Writeup: AI-Powered Note-Taking Application

**Course:** COMP5241 - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT
**Student ID:** 24012779G  
**Date:** October 4, 2025  

## 📋 Executive Summary

This lab demonstrates the power of AI-driven development. **100% of the implementation was handled by AI agents** using Claude Sonnet 4 model in agent mode. I didn't need to write any code or fix any issues manually - the AI handled everything from feature requests to deployment fixes, including choosing GitHub Models API for the translation functionality.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

1. **🤖 AI Translation**: English to Chinese using GitHub Models API
2. **🏷️ Auto-tagging**: AI categorization of note content  
3. **💡 Smart Suggestions**: AI writing assistance
4. **📄 Export Options**: PDF, Markdown, and DOCX export
5. **☁️ Cloud Integration**: Supabase PostgreSQL database
6. **🚀 Deployment**: Live on Vercel platform

## 🤖 AI Agent Experience

**Key Insight**: The AI handled the entire development process autonomously. From my initial request for translation functionality, the AI chose to implement GitHub Models API directly without me needing to specify which API service to use.

**What the AI Did:**
- Chose appropriate technologies and APIs
- Designed database schemas
- Built complete frontend and backend
- Fixed deployment issues independently  
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Managed dependencies and configurations

**My Role**: Simply provided high-level requirements. The AI made all technical decisions and implementations.

## 📈 Development Process

**Phase 1**: Asked for AI translation feature → AI implemented complete translation system with GitHub Models API

**Phase 2**: Needed cloud database → AI migrated from SQLite to Supabase PostgreSQL automatically  

**Phase 3**: Required deployment → AI configured Vercel serverless deployment with proper entry points

**Phase 4**: Requested advanced features → AI built auto-tagging, smart suggestions, and export functionality

## 🛠 Technical Results

**Architecture**: Clean Flask app with service layers, enhanced database schema, and responsive UI

**Database**: PostgreSQL with translation fields, AI analysis data, and tag management system

**APIs**: RESTful endpoints for all features including AI analysis and multi-format export

**Frontend**: Modern interface with translation, tagging, suggestions panel, and export modal

## 🎯 Challenges Overcome by AI

1. **API Selection**: Chose GitHub Models API for reliable translation service
2. **Serverless Issues**: Fixed Vercel deployment problems independently  
3. **Database Migration**: Handled complex PostgreSQL migration seamlessly
4. **Repository Setup**: Guided through GitHub repository configuration

## 🎓 Key Lessons

**Main Learning**: AI can function as a complete development team, handling everything from architecture decisions to deployment fixes.

**Impact**: Development speed increased dramatically - what would take weeks was completed in days.

**Quality**: AI-generated code followed best practices and included comprehensive documentation without being asked.

**Future**: This represents a shift toward AI-assisted development where humans provide requirements and AI handles implementation.

## Conversation Examples

**Initial Translation Request:**
```
Me: "can you help me add a translate function which using AI model to translate the content from english to chinese"

AI: [Implemented complete translation system with GitHub Models API, database schema updates, frontend UI, and error handling]
```

**Database Migration:**
```
Me: "i need to change to database from local to use supabase postgresql, and i need to deploy the app to Vercel cloud platform"

AI: [Automatically handled Supabase migration, fixed connection strings, configured Vercel deployment]
```

**Advanced Features Request:**
```
Me: "help me implement the below new functions:
**Auto-tagging**: AI-powered automatic categorization
**Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered writing assistance  
**Export Options**: PDF, Markdown, DOCX export"

AI: [Built complete database schema, AI analysis service, export functionality, enhanced UI]
```

**Documentation Request:**
```
Me: "help me update the readme if needed"

AI: [Created comprehensive README with all new features documented]
```

## 🔮 Conclusion

This lab proved that modern AI agents can handle complete application development autonomously. The AI's ability to self-correct, choose appropriate technologies, and solve complex deployment issues demonstrates the future of software development.
